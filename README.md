Project Walkthrough:

Welcome / Home Page

When you open AI Anveshana, you’ll see the title and a tagline: “Journey through the cosmos … discover exoplanets using AI.”
You’ll see sections like AI Models (Kepler, K2, TESS) with “AI Analysis” offers. 
Also visible: Dataset Explorer, stats (e.g. “1,500+ Total Exoplanets”), and features like 3D visualization, filtering, multi-mission data.
You can click “Explore Current Satellites” or “Explore Dataset →” to go deeper. 
Mission Analysis Pages (Kepler, K2, TESS)
These pages allow you to:

Upload or input transit / light-curve / planet parameters.

Run AI analysis (via Gemini / ML models) to classify a candidate (confirmed / false-positive / candidate).
View reasoning — the chatbot may explain why it classifies it that way, refer to model features, thresholds, etc.
Compare model & AI outputs side by side.
Each mission page is specialized (e.g. K2 page will use K2-specific datasets and model tuning).

Dataset Explorer

This page lists all known exoplanets (from Kepler, K2, TESS).
You can filter by parameters: orbital period, planet size, stellar temperature, etc.
You can visualize in 3D — see spatial positions of exoplanets in a galactic coordinate view.
You can inspect each planet (click it) to open details and jump into mission analysis if you want to test with that planet.

Chat Assistant (AI Anveshana)

The chat bot is accessible (floating icon / widget) across pages.
You can ask questions like “What is a habitable zone?” or “How does TESS detect planets?”
It responds in short, space-themed style explaining exoplanet science, mission workflows, or guiding you on which page to use.
The chat history persists during your session (unless you reset).

Navigation Flow (Typical User Journey)

Start at Home → click “Kepler Analysis”
Input planet parameters or pick from dataset → run AI + ML analysis
Review classification & reasoning
Jump to dataset explorer to see similar planets
Chat with AI for clarifications or help
Use TESS or K2 page similarly
